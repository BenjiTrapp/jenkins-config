    CS-14956: Fixing an issue that surfaced while testing rate limiting
    policies. An error was getting reported during policy map creation that
    config operation was in progress, Added synchronization to make sure
    sending and receiving commands are seralized. Also removed the retry logic
    as after this change it is not needed.
