    bug 14484: Apply existed firewall rules when associating IP
    
    It's not a elegant fix. The status for firewall rules should remain unchanged
    before/after ip association/disassociation. But the related change is tricky
    than this fix, may not get enough test for 3.0.1. So we would apply existed
    firewall rules again, which would work, just result in some unnecessary
    commands.
    
    status 14484: resolved fixed
