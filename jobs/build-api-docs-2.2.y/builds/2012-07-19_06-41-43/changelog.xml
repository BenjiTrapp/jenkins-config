    Fix CS-15603. When a VM is force deleted and the host is not available then CS simply marks the state in db as "Destroyed/Expunging". The VM is still running on the host and once it becomes available again there is a discrepancy in state of the VM. In this scenario the VM is removed from the host when the next full cluster sync happens.
