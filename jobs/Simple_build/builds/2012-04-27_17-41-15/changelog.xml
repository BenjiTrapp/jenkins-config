    CS-14421: Fix default interfaces file
    
    I can't see why we set eth0 to dhcp by default. It would result in eth0 want to
    get a DHCP address from outside. We should always assign ip through
    cloud-early-config for it.
    
    But one point is, the priority of cloud-early-config and networking script is
    the same.  So even networking got some ip from outside, cloud-early-config
    should able to override it(if cloud-early-config runs after networking) or
    networking script won't get dhcp (if cloud-early-config runs before networking),
    so I am not quite understand why router would get DHCP address in fact. Maybe
    there are other issues.
