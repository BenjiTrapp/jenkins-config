    Bug 13224 - Network Usage - Netscaler - External device is being queried multiple times (up to 8 times) whenever the Network Usage task is run.
    
    Reviewed-By: Kishan
    
    Changes:
    - Added local cache to store the usage answer per LB device per zone
    - Also there can be multiple domainRouters for an account. We can avoid processing the same account for usage by maintaining accounts already processed.
