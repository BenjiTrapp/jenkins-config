    libvirt: Replace the libvirt bindings with upstream 0.4.8
    
    Although these bindings have to be removed for the first Apache release
    we place the upstream JAR here.
    
    The 0.4.5 bindings were homebrew and contained own code which wasn't sent upstream.
    
    These changes were sent upstream and got into 0.4.8.
    
    For now we keep  the 0.4.8 bindings in the repo until we have a new build system in place
    which handles this.
    
    This is still however a release blocker since we can't distribute these bindings from the Apache servers!
