    cloudstack 3.0 UI - listView - when clicking fast between different rows, JS error "args.context.xxx is undefined" appears.  e.g. "args.context.instances is undefined" appears when clicking fast between different rows in listView in instance page. Because when clicking fast, users might click another row before API response for this current row is back => which causes the JS error.  The fix is to overlay the whole listView by loading image (spinning wheel image) until click-handling for this row is done (e.g. API response is back).
